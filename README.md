## Credits

This website (template) is based on [Gatsby's RolwinReevan Portfolio template](https://github.com/rolwin100/rolwinreevan_gatsby_blog) using [ant-design](https://ant.design).

It is rewritten for academic usage with the help of [Reapor-Yurnero](https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero).

Full credits for this awesome website template goes to [tc-imba's Gatsby Personal Website Template for Academic Usage](https://github.com/tc-imba/gatsby-theme-academic/tree/master).

## Why Gatsby?

Because of The Great Gatsby!! On a serious note though, being written in Javascript it can be used with React.js almost with no extra effort. Also, it's my hope someday to augment the website with some cool Three.js animations (you know the stuff where everything flies on the screen making browsing almost impossible :smile:)

### Build + deploy notes

- Clean up cache before during development for "hot" reloading `rm -rf example/node_modules/.bin example/node_modules/.cache/ example/.cache/ deploy/public/`.
- deploy using `yarn deploy` (takes a few minutes to take effect), develop using `yarn develop` (almost instantaneous).

- Processed and cleaned 490k+ records, applying imputation, text normalization, and outlier detection to improve
data quality.
- Engineered NLP features with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec to enhance sentiment and rating prediction.
- Built and optimized a logistic regression model, optimizing performance with L1/L2 regularization and feature
selection.
- Assessed model accuracy using RMSE and R-squared, performed error analysis, visualized key insights and feature
importance to support data-driven product recommendations.

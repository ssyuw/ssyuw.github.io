- Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in geographic, climate-related, and economic
data related to power outages.
- Designed and implemented feature engineering processes, including encoding time series data and extracting key
insights from geographic and temporal variables to enhance model performance.
- Built and optimized a predictive model using gradient boosting trees, achieving high accuracy in identifying
power outage causes linked to natural disasters.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning by analyzing recall, precision, and F1 scores, improving the modelâ€™s overall
reliability and predictive capability.

Our LLM-Based Web Agent Project focuses on developing an intelligent automation system that seamlessly integrates large language models (LLMs) with browser proxy automation and computer vision technologies. The primary goal of the project is to create an adaptive web agent capable of handling complex tasks such as dynamic data extraction, intelligent content interaction, and automated decision-making.

Using Selenium, the system efficiently manages browser proxy automation, enabling real-time interaction with dynamic web pages, handling complex user interface elements, and extracting structured and unstructured data from various online sources. To enhance visual recognition capabilities, the project incorporates OpenCV for background subtraction, boundary detection, and feature extraction, ensuring accurate target identification even in challenging environments.

A key concept of this project is the integration of LLMs into the automation pipeline. This allows the agent to perform advanced natural language processing tasks, optimize task workflows, and make data-driven decisions autonomously. The LLM enhances both the inference speed and accuracy, making the web agent highly adaptable to different applications, including intelligent web scraping, automated monitoring, and smart data analysis.
